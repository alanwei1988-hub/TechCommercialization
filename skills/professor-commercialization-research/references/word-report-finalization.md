# Final Word Report Generation

Use this reference only when the user explicitly requests a `.docx` technology-commercialization report. Word is not part of the default 2.0 package; the default deliverables are the 商业化分析 PPT and 论文列表 Excel.

## Required sequence

1. Confirm the structured analysis source exists. If the default package was already built, use the 商业化分析 PPT narrative and 论文列表 Excel evidence IDs as references; do not require an HTML report.
2. Start from structured source material such as metadata JSON, the PPT claim/evidence map, or workbook sheets. Do not rebuild the report by copy/paste or convert slide objects directly into Word tables.
3. Preserve the decision-first narrative: executive recommendation, capability map, opportunity comparison, Lead Wedge, customer problem, product, market, commercialization vehicle, readiness gaps, team/IP, 30/60/90-day plan, scholar questions, and evidence appendix.
4. If HTML is explicitly requested and used as a source, parse it with a real HTML parser such as `lxml` or BeautifulSoup. Preserve the source section order and compare resulting Word headings against the intended narrative.
5. Use the documents skill for DOCX generation. Read its `SKILL.md`, creation/editing guide, design preset guidance, and render/verify guide before producing the final Word artifact.
6. Pick a conservative report style such as `standard_business_brief` or a similarly restrained Chinese business-report style. Use explicit styles rather than Word defaults.
7. Generate the DOCX into a writable workspace first. Copy it to the project/output folder only after structural checks pass.
8. Run render/inspect QA with `render_docx.py` whenever `soffice`/LibreOffice is available. If rendering cannot be made available, perform structural QA and disclose that visual PNG review was not completed.

## PPT/HTML-to-Word content mapping pitfalls

- Treat PPT slide titles as the narrative claims, not as Word section text to copy verbatim without context.
- Expand concise slide evidence into short prose using the structured source and preserve `Pxx` and `Sxx` identifiers.
- Convert dense appendix evidence into a source appendix or compact tables; do not make the entire Word report a sequence of tables.
- Keep the full publication inventory in the 论文列表 Excel unless the user explicitly asks to embed it in Word.

- HTML cards are not always `div.card`; they may be `article.card`, `section.card`, or nested containers. Treat any element whose class contains `card`, `callout`, or a known report component class as a candidate content block.
- Do not assume grid children are only `div` elements. For opportunity sections, `article.card opportunity` is common and must be included.
- For cards with a `.row` heading and `.pill` status, create a Word subheading such as `Title - Status`, then write every paragraph below it.
- Skip interactive controls such as filters, search inputs, and sticky nav bars. Convert them only to static table headings or a simple contents list when useful.
- Preserve section-level notes, callouts, timeline items, opportunity cards, benchmark tables, interview-question tables, paper-browser tables, and sources/limits.
- Translate generic English headings into the target report language when the surrounding report is localized. For Chinese reports, use `执行摘要` instead of `Executive Summary`.

## Word layout pitfalls

- Do not rely on built-in Word `Heading 1/2/3` styles when previous templates or imports may contaminate numbering, bullets, or `keepNext`. Prefer custom styles for generated reports.
- Explicitly set East Asian fonts in OOXML (`w:eastAsia`) as well as `ascii`/`hAnsi`. For Chinese reports, prefer installed fonts such as `Noto Sans SC`, `Microsoft YaHei`, or `DengXian`; verify the font exists on the machine when possible.
- Clear heading `w:numPr`, `w:keepNext`, `w:pageBreakBefore`, and unwanted inherited paragraph settings. A heading with accidental numbering can render as black square/bullet-like marks.
- Use fixed table geometry: explicit `tblW`, `tblGrid`, `tcW`, table indent, and cell margins. Avoid autofit for benchmark, interview, and paper-browser tables.
- Put very wide tables, especially paper-browser tables, in landscape sections. Keep identifier columns compact and reserve width for analysis and plain-language application columns.
- Repeat table header rows for multi-page tables and keep row heights flexible. Do not use fixed row heights that can clip Chinese text.
- If a section renders as a nearly blank page, inspect the DOCX paragraphs around that heading. The most likely causes are skipped source elements, accidental page/section breaks, or `keepNext` forcing content forward.

## Tooling pitfalls from Windows runs

- Check for an existing `soffice.exe` before installing anything. Common locations include `C:\Program Files\LibreOffice\program\soffice.exe` and bundled runtime folders.
- Chocolatey installs often require an elevated administrator shell and may fail when Codex is not elevated.
- LibreOffice MSI administrative extraction can fail with Windows Installer errors such as `1603`, `2502`, or `2503`, or when `MsiSystemRebootPending=1`.
- PortableApps installers may not honor silent flags in every environment and can wait behind hidden UI. Do not leave hidden installer processes running.
- Word COM automation can hang or fail in desktop sessions. Smoke-test with a tiny DOCX before relying on it, and do not kill user-visible Word windows. Only clean up background processes you created and can identify.
- If rendering dependencies cannot be installed safely, stop trying after the reasonable routes above, perform structural QA, and state the limitation clearly.

## Structural QA checklist

- Compare the Word H1 list to the source report section list. Confirm localized heading replacements such as `执行摘要`.
- Confirm the executive section states the Lead Wedge, alternatives, score, confidence, buyer, product, killer risks, and next action.
- Confirm the commercialization-vehicle section compares startup, licensing, joint development, service, or other relevant routes instead of assuming a company must be formed.
- Confirm table dimensions for benchmark, interview-question, and paper-browser tables against the source.
- Search the DOCX XML for obsolete headings or leaked English labels when a localized title is required.
- Check `word/document.xml` for unexpected `w:numPr`, `w:keepNext`, and `w:pageBreakBefore` in generated body headings.
- If the destination file is open and locked, write a sibling `_fixed.docx` or timestamped copy and tell the user why it was not overwritten.
