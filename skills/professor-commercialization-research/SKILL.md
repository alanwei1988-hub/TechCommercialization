name: professor-commercialization-research
description: Build a sourced research and commercialization dossier from a professor, researcher, PI, lab, or academic team name. Use when Codex needs to disambiguate an academic identity, collect publications, summarize papers, map research directions and timeline, deep-dive selected papers, benchmark companies, generate targeted scholar interview question lists, or advise on technology transfer/startup opportunities. Also use when the user says "技术商业化分析skill", "技术商业化分析", or asks for a technology commercialization analysis skill. If invoked without a target institution and scholar, first ask which institution/lab and scholar the user wants to study.

# Technology Commercialization Analysis

## Overview

Turn a professor or lab name into a traceable dossier covering publications, research trajectory, key results, and commercialization potential. Favor evidence-backed analysis over broad biography.

If the user gives no scope, assume the last 10 years, include peer-reviewed papers plus relevant preprints/chapters, and produce outputs in the user's language. Prefer an Excel workbook for iterative research, with Word or readable HTML only when narrative reading is more important. Do not use Markdown as the final user-facing deliverable unless the user explicitly asks for it.

Run autonomously for an entry-level technical manager. The only planned user checkpoint is step 5, where the user may optionally choose specific research results for deeper commercial-hypothesis testing.

## Invocation

If the user invokes only "技术商业化分析skill", "技术商业化分析", or the skill name without naming a target, ask one short question before starting:

> 你想研究哪个机构的哪位学者？如果已有关注时间范围、重点产业方向或交付格式，也可以一起告诉我。

If the user already provides the institution and scholar, start the workflow without additional intake questions unless the identity is ambiguous.

## Workflow

1. **Scope and identity**
   - If the target institution/lab and scholar are missing, ask for them first using the invocation question above.
   - Disambiguate the person with affiliation, department, lab page, name variants, coauthors, ORCID/DBLP/Google Scholar/Semantic Scholar/OpenAlex, and official university pages.
   - Record assumptions, source URLs, and any ambiguity before building the corpus.
   - If the identity is genuinely ambiguous, ask a concise clarification question.

2. **Corpus acquisition**
   - Build a publication table with title, year, venue, authors, DOI/arXiv/URL, source, type, and inclusion status.
   - Deduplicate by DOI, normalized title, and author/year; keep rejected near-duplicates in notes if they could affect trust.
   - Download only open, lawful PDFs or author copies. Keep the PDF source URL and a download status.
   - Save machine-readable metadata early so later analysis can be regenerated.

3. **Paper-level analysis**
   - For each included paper, write one compact paragraph explaining the research question, method, result, and limitation.
   - Add a plain-language explanation that answers: what is it, why does it matter, and where might it be used?
   - Separate what the paper proves from what is an inferred application.

4. **Research direction synthesis**
   - Cluster papers by technical theme, target problem, method, and application domain.
   - Create a timeline showing shifts in methods, domains, collaborators, and venues.
   - Identify key nodes: first appearance of a direction, strongest result, most commercially relevant paper, and recent pivot.

5. **Optional user checkpoint: selected-paper deep dives**
   - After producing or previewing the numbered research-result list, ask once whether the user wants any specific results deep-dived.
   - Ask for paper/result numbers matching the Excel `Paper Browser` or equivalent list; ask for a commercial hypothesis only as optional context.
   - Use a lightweight prompt such as: "请选择需要深入分析的成果序号；也可以补充你的商业假设。没有也没关系，我会直接进入商业化综合分析。"
   - Do not block the project if the user does not provide selections. Continue to step 6 with no user-selected deep dives, or with agent-selected high-signal examples only when useful.
   - When the user proposes a commercialization hypothesis, test it against the paper's actual claims.
   - Use full text where available: search for keywords, read abstract/introduction/method/evaluation/conclusion, and extract concise evidence.
   - Classify the hypothesis as accurate, partially accurate, or inaccurate; then rewrite it into the most defensible product framing.

6. **Commercialization analysis**
   - Map research capabilities to industry pain points, buyer personas, deployment constraints, and regulatory/tailwind context.
   - Distinguish product, component, data asset, evaluation service, consulting, and custom project opportunities.
   - Explicitly assess build-vs-buy risk: what large customers will self-build, what they still buy, and where a neutral third party matters.
   - Benchmark domestic and international commercial companies, adjacent platform products, and open-source substitutes; say "temporarily sparse/blank" only after explaining whether the product category is early, hidden inside platforms, or not yet commercially visible.

7. **Interview question list**
   - Generate a targeted question list for a technical manager interviewing the scholar.
   - Make the list business-manager first: questions should help a non-specialist technical manager diagnose commercial potential, demand, resources, technology maturity, company design, operating commitment, governance, and next consulting steps.
   - Treat technical paper details as supporting evidence or follow-up prompts, not the main question spine.
   - Adapt the general flow of project overview, commercial scenario, demand/resource diagnosis, technology maturity, IP/ownership, company/productization path, team and roles, funding/policy resources, operating governance, risks, needs, and closeout.
   - Ground questions in the analyzed research directions, representative papers, plain-language applications, commercialization hypotheses, benchmarks, and missing evidence.
   - Do not reuse the reference document's title/background unless the user explicitly asks. Produce an interview-ready artifact, not a generic questionnaire.

8. **Deliverables**
   - For spreadsheet outputs, use the spreadsheet skill and include sheets such as `Overview`, `Paper Browser`, `Directions`, `Timeline`, `Deep Dives`, `Commercialization`, `Benchmarks`, and `Interview Questions`.
   - For narrative outputs, create a Word document or concise HTML report with filters, tables, or section anchors when useful.
   - Ensure final user-facing deliverables are Excel, Word, or readable HTML. Supporting metadata, scripts, PDFs, and notes may remain in the project folder.
   - Keep source PDFs, metadata, scripts, and final deliverables in a dedicated project folder.

9. **Validation**
   - Verify paper counts, downloaded PDF counts, source links, and date range.
   - Check that every included paper has both technical and plain-language summaries.
   - Check that the interview question list is specific to the scholar's research rather than generic.
   - For HTML deliverables, check table layout: compact identifier columns, give analysis/plain-language columns enough width, and ensure sticky headers or anchors do not cover content.
   - Browse for current market, company, policy, or regulatory facts; cite sources.
   - Flag confidence levels and avoid overstating commercial readiness.
